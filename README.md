## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Top 10 Pull Requests Only:** Due to current limitations of the GPT-4o API (used via GitHub Copilot), the feed is capped to show the **10 most recent pull requests**.
- **Slowness due to Real-Time Feed generation:** Feeds are generated by the AI model in real time, so you could see 10-15 sec delay.
